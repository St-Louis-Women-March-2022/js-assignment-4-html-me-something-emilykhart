              <p>I became a pastry chef officially in 2017, but the journey began a long time before. When I was a kid, I loved making cookies with my Mom and Dad. I remember specifically one time with
                my Dad where we forgot baking soda. Guess what? You definitely need that if you want any chance at a proper cookie. From there, I started making my own and actually following the recipe.
                As the years went on, I branched off from just your plain chocolate chip cookies to even more adventurous items.</p> 
                
                <p>When I moved to Indianapolis in 2012, baking became the way I spent my free time 
                and it soon became a passion. In 2014, a major shift in the way my company operated and I knew I wanted a change. So I called up my Mom, and asked if I could move back home and go to culinary school.
                Five months later, I was back in St. Louis, enrolled in school, and became a baker at The Cup in the Central West End. I have remained there and grown in my position over the last seven years.
                Here you will see my favorite things I have created in school, at home, and at work. I love baking and making people smile with their bellies full of sugary goodness!

    <h3 id="pastryHead">Welcome to the Thunder Dome</h3>
      <p id="schoolText">In 2015, I enrolled in Forest Park Community College and started their Baking and Pastry Program. Throughout the program, we covered
          breads, pastries, cake decorating, sugar work, and chocolate work. My favorite class was our bread sections. We got to make croissants, 
          bagels, and even designed bread wreaths. My most challenging class was chocolate work. Making a basket out of weaved chocolate almost broke 
          me but I prevailed! After 2 years, I graduated as a Certified Pastry Chef.

    <h3 id="workHeader">My Cup Runneth Over!</h3>
      <p id="workText">Three weeks after I came back to St. Louis, I accepted a job as a Baker at The Cup in the Central West End. Since then, I have been Head Baker, Production Supervisor, and just this summer 
        will transition into the Corporate Information Coordinator and Wholesale Manager. My favorite thing about my job is creating our April Fools' Day Cupcake. Every year I create an imposter cupcake
        that looks like something totally different but made of cupcakes! This past year was Chicken and Waffles! It is an intense four months of preparation but it keeps me creatively satisfied.

    <h3 id="personalProjects">Personal Favorite Creations</h3>
      <p id="personalText">While I don't get to bake as much as I would like with work and now LaunchCode, I still try and bake for friends and family. My go to gift for weddings is making their cake for them
        or their anniversary cake! I still love baking chocolate chip cookies and make a MASSIVE amount for the Christmas holiday. I will also sometimes for holidays pull out my old bread book from either my Mom or
        the one I had during school to try and whip up something delicious. Hopefully, after LaunchCode is done, my passion for baking at home can continue with my job focused elsewhere.

    <h3 class="statementHead">What is Next?</h3>
    <p id="statement">What I hope for in the future is to be able to fulfill my passion for baking and use what I am learning now to create a work/life balance. Outside of baking, I love 
        spending time with my nephew and niece. They are such joys! I love to craft -- especially making seasonal wreaths. I am a huge space nerd. I have been to Space Camp and even had an
        internship at NASA one summer working with Website Accessibility. I live near the Botanical Gardens and on cooler days, it is wonderful to take advantage of it being across the street 
        and having Tower Grove park a short walk from my apartment.
