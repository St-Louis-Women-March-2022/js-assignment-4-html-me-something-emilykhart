            <h3 id="aboutMeHeader">About Me</h3>
               <p>I became a pastry chef officially in 2017, but the journey began a long time before. When I was a kid, I loved making cookies with my Mom and Dad. I remember specifically one time with
               my Dad where we forgot baking soda. Guess what? You definitely need that if you want any chance at a proper cookie. From there, I started making my own and actually following the recipe.
               As the years went on, I branched off from just your plain chocolate chip cookies to even more adventurous items. When I moved to Indianapolis in 2012, baking became the way I spent my free time 
               and it soon became a passion. In 2014, a major shift in the way my company operated and I knew I wanted a change. So I called up my Mom, and asked if I could move back home and go to culinary school.
               Five months later, I was back in St. Louis, enrolled in school, and became a baker at The Cup in the Central West End. I have remained there and grown in my position over the last seven years.
               Here you will see my favorite things I have created in school, at home, and at work. I love baking and making people smile with their bellies full of sugary goodness!

        <p id="schoolText">In 2015, I enrolled in Forest Park Community College and started their Baking and Pastry Program. Throughout the program, we covered
          breads, pastries, cake decorating, sugar work, and chocolate work. My favorite class was our bread sections. We got to make croissants, 
          bagels, and even designed bread wreaths. My most challenging class was chocolate work. Making a basket out of weaved chocolate almost broke 
          me but I prevailed! After 2 years, I graduated as a Certified Pastry Chef.
